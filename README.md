### General

- **Replace Account Category:** Hides the sidebar "Account" category and adds a custom popup menu to the profile icon with quick links to Profile Settings and Logout.
- **Remove-exit-discount:** Removes the most annoying popup ever (the exit discount modal and its backdrop) from falixnodes.net.

- **Hide Support Category:** Hides the Support category from the navigation and main interface.

### Console

- **Hide Console Tabs:** Optionally hide unnecessary console tabs for a cleaner interface (added to Falix itself using a dropdown, this feature will just delete the dropdown button itself).
- **replace Support Modal:** Replaces the support modal with a cleaner one and adds a copy all button.
- **Remove How To Connect:** Removes all "How to connect" steps, DNS verification sections, and the "Server Name" row from the connect button and adds back the IPwithPORT.

- **Move Admin Panel nav-Button:** Move the Admin Panel from Account category to the Servers section.
- **Admin Panel Index Redirect:** Redirect the Admin Panel link on the navbar to /admin/index instead of /admin to fix navbar issues.

- **Add Admin Pages Category:** takes all the "pages" from the admin panel and ads them to the normal navbar for better accessibility.
- **Duplicate Admin Buttons** duplicates the save buttons at the bottom of the admin server so it's also at the top.
- **Copy All Support Info:** Adds a Copy All button to ticket support information for quick copying of server ID, PIN, and ticket details.

### Archived features

Warning: These features are archived, this is either because they are replaced or because they got implemented into the native page.
Enabling these features might cause issues or incompatibilities with other plugins or native features.

- **Editor Fullscreen**: Adds a button to the file editor toolbar that allows you to make the editor and toolbar take up the entire browser window (added to falix itself).

- **Collapsible Log Analysis:** Add a collapse/expand button to the Log Analysis section (added to falix itself).
- **Editor Wrapper Height:** Sets the file editor height to 600px (new height can be configured in the config) (the issue this was fixing got solved).
- **Remove "Remote Startup" Nav Item:** Hide the "Remote Startup" navigation item from the sidebar (removed from the navbar by default now).
- **Hide Closed Tickets toggle:** Removed because of vanilla change

## Usage

1. **Install the Extension:**  
   Load the extension into your browser (e.g., via Chrome's "Load unpacked" feature).

2. **Open the Popup:**  
   Click the Better Falix icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.

3. **Toggle Features:**  
   Use the checkboxes to enable or disable individual features. Use the main toggle button to enable or disable all features at once.

   Most changes take effect immediately. If not, try refreshing the FalixNodes page.

## Development
### Adding a basic feature:

- To add new features, create a new folder in the `features/` directory and put your main code inside together with (optional) extra data and/or assets.

- Add your feature to the popup by adding:
popup.HTML:

```html
      <div class="feature-row">
        <span class="feature-label" data-tooltip="1 line Feature description here (by author).">FEATURE NAME</span>
        <button class="feature-btn" id="removeConsoleFilesCategory" aria-pressed="false" tabindex="0"><span class="dot"></span></button>
      </div>
```

popup.js:

```js
const featureIds = [
    FEATURENAME: false // add this line to the end
   ];
```

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  chrome.storage.sync.get({
    FEATURENAME: false, // add this line to the end
```

manifest.json:

```json
    {
      "matches": ["https://client.falixnodes.net/server/versions*"],
      "js": ["features/FEATURE-NAME/index.js"],
      "run_at": "document_idle"
    }
```

README.md

```md
### FEATURENAME

- List all changes made by this feature here (specifying the author).
```

- All feature scripts should check the global "enabled" state and their individual feature flag before running.

Start your script with:

```js
// [better-falix] FEATURENAME: Script loading
console.log('[better-falix] FEATURE-NAME: Script loading');

chrome.storage.sync.get({ featureName: false, enabled: true }, (data) => {
  if (!data.enabled || !data.featureName) {
    console.log('[better-falix] FEATURE-NAME: Script disabled');
    return;
  }
  console.log('[better-falix] FEATURE-NAME: Script enabled');

  //  --------- START FEATURE ----------
```

### adding options.
To add an options icon, the following should be added between the </span> and <button> elements in the popup.html:
```html
<svg class="feature-settings-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" title="Open settings for this feature"><path d="M495.9 166.6c3.2 8.7 .5 18.4-6.4 24.6l-43.3 39.4c1.1 8.3 1.7 16.8 1.7 25.4s-.6 17.1-1.7 25.4l43.3 39.4c6.9 6.2 9.6 15.9 6.4 24.6c-4.4 11.9-9.7 23.3-15.8 34.3l-4.7 8.1c-6.6 11-14 21.4-22.1 31.2c-5.9 7.2-15.7 9.6-24.5 6.8l-55.7-17.7c-13.4 10.3-28.2 18.9-44 25.4l-12.5 57.1c-2 9.1-9 16.3-18.2 17.8c-13.8 2.3-28 3.5-42.5 3.5s-28.7-1.2-42.5-3.5c-9.2-1.5-16.2-8.7-18.2-17.8l-12.5-57.1c-15.8-6.5-30.6-15.1-44-25.4L83.1 425.9c-8.8 2.8-18.6 .3-24.5-6.8c-8.1-9.8-15.5-20.2-22.1-31.2l-4.7-8.1c-6.1-11-11.4-22.4-15.8-34.3c-3.2-8.7-.5-18.4 6.4-24.6l43.3-39.4C64.6 273.1 64 264.6 64 256s.6-17.1 1.7-25.4L22.4 191.2c-6.9-6.2-9.6-15.9-6.4-24.6c4.4-11.9 9.7-23.3 15.8-34.3l4.7-8.1c6.6-11 14-21.4 22.1-31.2c5.9-7.2 15.7-9.6 24.5-6.8l55.7 17.7c13.4-10.3 28.2-18.9 44-25.4l12.5-57.1c2-9.1 9-16.3 18.2-17.8C227.3 1.2 241.5 0 256 0s28.7 1.2 42.5 3.5c9.2 1.5 16.2 8.7 18.2 17.8l12.5 57.1c15.8 6.5 30.6 15.1 44 25.4l55.7-17.7c8.8-2.8 18.6-.3 24.5 6.8c8.1 9.8 15.5 20.2 22.1 31.2l4.7 8.1c6.1 11 11.4 22.4 15.8 34.3zM256 336a80 80 0 1 0 0-160 80 80 0 1 0 0 160z"/></svg>
```
the following should be added to the options.html:
```html
    <div class="feature-block">
      <div class="feature-header">
        <span class="feature-title">example feature</span>
        <button class="feature-toggle" id="FEATUREIDHERE" aria-pressed="false" tabindex="0"><span class="dot"></span></button>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-desc">what you put here will be the description above the input.</div>
      <div class="setting-row">
        <span class="setting-label">Input name here:</span>
        <input class="setting-input" id="SETTINGSIDHERE" type="number" min="1" max="100" value="30"> <!-- don't forget to change the min, max and default values -->
      </div>
    </div>
```
and the following in options.js:

```js
const FEATURENAMEToggle = document.getElementById('FEATURENAME');
if (customServerOrderToggle) {
  customServerOrderToggle.addEventListener('click', function() {
    const state = this.getAttribute('aria-pressed') !== 'true';
    setToggleState(this, state);
    saveSetting('FEATURE NAME', state);
  });
}


```


## Logging

All logging should use the following format:

```log
[Better-Falix] FEATURE-NAME: logged message here
```

with the FEATURE-NAME being the name of the folder (with -)

A basic feature logs the following events:

- Script loading (at the start of the file)
- Script Enabled (after the enabled check)
- Script Disabled (when the enabled check fails)
- Script loaded successfully (somewhere at the end)
